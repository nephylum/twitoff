# Whose tweet? A tweet likelihood app
A fun web app for predicting which twitter users would be more likely to tweet something.


# How it use it
Enter users to compare, a tweet and then click "compare" to see which user is more likely to have tweeted that.


# How it works
The backend will take your inputs, grab tweets from the users and use them to train a logistic regression model, and then that is used to predict which user is the most likely to tweet your tweet!
